/* Since the column is numerical and a null represents a missing value rather than a true zero. 
I'm going to fill column with Median to keeps all rows without skewing averages drastically.
Benefits: Provides a reasonable estimate without removing data.
Median imputation is preferred when the distribution is skewed, 
as the median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.

-- CLEANNING DATA
-- Calculate MEDIAN

/* Calculating the median in SQL can be a bit tricky because there isnâ€™t a built-in MEDIAN function in most SQL databases. 
 * However, it is still absolutely possible to calculate Median in SQL using window functions or subqueries.
 
First, we should understand the mathematical formula used to calculate Median.
For a dataset having N elements, ordered from smallest to greatest,
Median = (N+1)/2th element, if N is odd
Median = (N/2th element + (N/2 + 1)th element)/2, if N is even
From the above formula, we have keep in mind that the dataset must be ordered and we need to account for odd and even number of datapoints.

 * Right now, I want to find Median for column 'GDP per capita' 
 * 
 * 1. Using Window Functions (Works in SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL 8.0+, etc.)
*/


SELECT AVG(`GDP per capita`) AS median
FROM (
    SELECT `GDP per capita`,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY `GDP per capita`) AS row_num,
           COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_count
    FROM worldhappinessindex2015 
) AS sub
WHERE row_num in ((total_count + 1) / 2, (total_count + 2) / 2);


/* Explanation:
The inner query assigns a row number (row_num) to each row, ordered by `GDP per capita`, 
and calculates the total row count (total_count).

The outer query finds the middle row(s):
If total_count is odd, it selects the middle row.
If total_count is even, it selects the two middle rows and averages them.
*/


-- 2. Alternative Approach: Using Percentile
SELECT distinct PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY `GDP per capita`) OVER() AS "Median"
FROM worldhappinessindex2015 

/*
This method calculates the exact 50th percentile, which is the median.
The ORDER BY GDP per capita clause sorts the values in ascending order before calculating the median. 
The DISTINCT keyword ensures that only a single result is returned for the overall median, even if multiple rows contain the median value. 
The OVER() function is used without any partitioning, so PERCENTILE_CONT is applied to the entire dataset.
