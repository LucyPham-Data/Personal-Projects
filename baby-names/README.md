<p> How have American baby name preferences evolved since 1920? Which names have remained popular for over a century, and how do they compare to today’s most popular names? These questions are common for new parents, but the skills we’ll use to answer them are broadly useful. Identifying trends and popularity is valuable across many industries! </p>

<p> We'll use data from the United States Social Security Administration, which records first names along with the number and gender of babies given each name annually. To optimize processing, our dataset is limited to names given to more than 5,000 American babies in a single year. This data spans 101 years, from 1920 through 2020. </p>
